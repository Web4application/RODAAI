    Sure, here is a simple loop in Swift:

    # Example 1
    ```
    for i in 1...5 {
      print("Hello, world!")
    }
    ```

    This loop will print the string "Hello, world!" five times. The for loop iterates over a range of numbers,
    in this case the numbers from 1 to 5. The variable i is assigned each number in the range, and the code inside the loop is executed.

    **Here is another example of a simple loop in Swift:**
    ```swift
    var sum = 0
    for i in 1...100 {
      sum += i
    }
    print("The sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is \\(sum).")
    ```

    This loop calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. The variable sum is initialized to 0, and then the for loop iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 100. The variable i is assigned each number in the range, and the value of i is added to the sum variable. After the loop has finished executing, the value of sum is printed to the console.

  static var sample = samples[0]
}
